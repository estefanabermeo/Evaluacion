We have two teenagers: a daughter, a son.
We are in the IT business and we love to travel. We always travel as if it was the last trip of our lives. For us, family, love and harmony are essential in life. We enjoy contemporary art and we are dedicated to promoting mexican artists and culture in every place we visit. 
Pancho and I met scuba diving in 1994, therefore the sea, nature and outdoor activities are basic and necessary. We enjoy camping, scuba diving and sailing, sport in which we compete every month in Acapulco.
Lunch time is a special moment for us, a pause where we can enjoy and celebrate being together, a moment apart from the rush of the city where we prepare ourselves for the afternoon daily commitments.
We love Mexico and we are ambassadors of our country, we always talk about how great is the mexican spirit, its culture, gastronomy, nature, beaches and its history. If we had to choose another country to live, it would be Italy for the same reasons we love Mexico.
We recognize ourselves as entrepreneurs because of our professional upbringing, we generate projects and ideas, some of which become business ventures. We've always been motivated by the risk, investing time, money and effort to develop new ideas with a purposeful end. Another factor deeply rooted in our family is ecology and self sustainability and seek to have the least possible impact on our environment and our planet .
We have a francophile part because the 4 of Pancho's grandparents were born in France and married in Mexico . With some friends, we spontaneously create an amateur theater group fifteen years ago, ""ThÃ©Ã¢tre a la DÃ©rive"", where we enjoy making plays in French just for the pleasure of the whole process, costumes, learning the script and friendship. The group is composed mainly by frenchies living in MÃ©xico.
Today what bring us here is that 14 years ago, on a sabathical year, we lived in a ""Chateau"" in France countryside, and we opened 11 rooms to host our beloved...  more than a hundred friends and family members came to visit and stayed with us in that 12th century castle. The uniqueness of this experience led us to replicate the model in Mexico, and we open our home with a project: Art Residence to share it with you, people with similar interests, that want to enjoy living among art in our village of San Angel,  town founded 500 years ago and today immersed in one of the largest and most exciting cities in the world: Mexico City.

I love travelling, meeting new people, sharing ideas, taste new food, shooting photographies, walking new ways and enjoy life. I really love getting involved into other cultures. I will suggest you the best places in town :) 

Me as a traveller: 
I am always planning a new trip. Since I started to travel by myself I never have been in a hotel. I prefer to get along with local people, see how they use to live. I always prefer to visit different places an not the usuals or touristic spaces of the cities. When I am in a new city I use to get out and start walking without direction and discover places by myself. I keep the maps in my bag and doesn't matter if I get lost, I like to recognize all the places around,  the streets,  the details, see everything that is posible, and find by myself all the different ways to get back home...  I have a lot of good memories in all the places I have visisted. I find the beauty of each city in the people that I met and in all the experiences that I have there, those are the first things that come to my mind when I think in some place, the rest comes apart. 
I don't want to be a tourist, I just want to make mine every place I visit. 

Favorite places: Chacahua, Oaxaca. Mexico, City, Chiapas, Mexico. New York, Paris, Ghent, Belgium. Sweeden, Tokyo, Berlin! 

Me as a guest: 
I am always trying to live new experiences.  I had experiencies with another ways to lodging and all them have been amazing. I just read about this project ""Airbnb"" and I found it great and denfinetily I knew that I had to try it. 
I'm very independent, most of the time I am out of the house. When there is time I like to get along with my hosts but also I am so respectful with your space, I'm very very very clean and orderly. I don't smoke. We can talk about music, movies, trips, books... I love sharing music. 
I am food lover, I receive all kind of suggestions!

We have two teenagers: a daughter, a son.
We are in the IT business and we love to travel. We always travel as if it was the last trip of our lives. For us, family, love and harmony are essential in life. We enjoy contemporary art and we are dedicated to promoting mexican artists and culture in every place we visit. 
Pancho and I met scuba diving in 1994, therefore the sea, nature and outdoor activities are basic and necessary. We enjoy camping, scuba diving and sailing, sport in which we compete every month in Acapulco.
Lunch time is a special moment for us, a pause where we can enjoy and celebrate being together, a moment apart from the rush of the city where we prepare ourselves for the afternoon daily commitments.
We love Mexico and we are ambassadors of our country, we always talk about how great is the mexican spirit, its culture, gastronomy, nature, beaches and its history. If we had to choose another country to live, it would be Italy for the same reasons we love Mexico.
We recognize ourselves as entrepreneurs because of our professional upbringing, we generate projects and ideas, some of which become business ventures. We've always been motivated by the risk, investing time, money and effort to develop new ideas with a purposeful end. Another factor deeply rooted in our family is ecology and self sustainability and seek to have the least possible impact on our environment and our planet .
We have a francophile part because the 4 of Pancho's grandparents were born in France and married in Mexico . With some friends, we spontaneously create an amateur theater group fifteen years ago, ""ThÃ©Ã¢tre a la DÃ©rive"", where we enjoy making plays in French just for the pleasure of the whole process, costumes, learning the script and friendship. The group is composed mainly by frenchies living in MÃ©xico.
Today what bring us here is that 14 years ago, on a sabathical year, we lived in a ""Chateau"" in France countryside, and we opened 11 rooms to host our beloved...  more than a hundred friends and family members came to visit and stayed with us in that 12th century castle. The uniqueness of this experience led us to replicate the model in Mexico, and we open our home with a project: Art Residence to share it with you, people with similar interests, that want to enjoy living among art in our village of San Angel,  town founded 500 years ago and today immersed in one of the largest and most exciting cities in the world: Mexico City.

The experience was very good, so in September 2014 decided to join as a host, offering a couple of options and prices to stay in Mexico City.

I like that the guests enjoy their stay and their space, in total privacy.

While the area has been residential for over 100 years, its âBohemian"" character has only been in existence since late 1980s. Condesa has a number of examples of older Art Deco and Art Nouveau architecture, as well as innovative modern designs. Walking distance from main museums and landmarks. An experience youâll never forget"

Travelling one of many passions.
My house is a temple,  love to share it with guests and treat them as they deserve. The energy one feels stepping inside the house is one of ""nice to be home""
Guess I expect to feel the same, when I travel.  

As a guest I will respect every corner of the house I get in, as I shall expect the guests that stay at my house do the same -when staying at my place-.

Love to:
Eat, enchanting places, art, 
to read and a movie freak.

My favorite destinations are the cities that have tons to tell. Europe and Eastern Europe are my favorite destinations. Asia, blows my mind. When I travel to Asia, I would probably stay in one of the best venues. History is part of my life so as long as the destination has historical links, it will probably fit in this category.

Una gran cosa sobre Condesa es tambiÃ©n que por la noche se puede encontrar de todo, desde una barra de la cadera alternativa, ""estilo pub irlandÃ©s"" o un lugar de lujo para llevar a cabo una fecha. Los taxis son relativamente baratos en MÃ©xico y 24 horas disponible. Si prefiere utilizar el transporte local (Metro + Bus), grandes estaciones estÃ¡n a menos de 5 minutos a pie."

Against Aztec domination, these people welcomed HernÃ¡n CortÃ©s and the Spanish, who used the area as a headquarters during the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire and made it the first capital of New Spain between 1521 and 1523.

I have multiple interests and activities that fill my schedule since my retirement. I work as a therapist, I study Eastern philosophies, I love to go to the movies and to concerts, to travel and to spoil my grandson.

I am looking forward to meet all interesting people who want to enjoy the peace of this quiet place in the heart of Condesa.

Greetings from a Mexican heart, my name is Daniel and Iâm thrilled to tell you about who I am and what I like.

I speak Spanish, English & Music (yes, it is also a language) I love music, I want to dedicate my life to learning, playing and listening to it around the world. I myself play guitar, piano and sing. 

I am also in the process of writing a book and Iâm currently developing an app too.

Iâm Buddhist coming from a Jewish family and I will always be up for a good meal and chat. I like to go out as much as I enjoy my own company. I am organized (some would say too much) and I always take care of those I love and matter to me.

Iâm currently on a 5 month trip around the USA on a journey to discover my own music as well as the history behind it, while I grow and explore what it means to grow up (I guess we all have to at some point)

Iâm very excited to get to know the world and learn from it.

If youâre a host, you read this, and youâre still thinking about taking me in or not, you have to know something very important before you make your mind...

Me considero honesta, autÃ©ntica y respeto a la gente, por lo que pido el mismo respeto a cambio.
Amo a los animales, especialmente a los gatos.
Amo a la naturaleza.

ItÂ´s a name I invented in Nahuatl.
Veritl = Woman always restless with adventures in the head.
I'm 46 years old. I love to tell people how old I am because it always increases my desire to live.
I love my beautiful Mexico City and I love that anyone who visits it either for pleasure or business will have the best experience. That's why I decided to share my life experience and my Mexican house: a place to just explore who you are.
I like a lot, a lot of things: eating, laughing, exercising, reading, learning, dressing, photographing, listening, talking and shutting up, but above all, I like to walk. ItÂ´s something I enjoy excessively. I love to walk in all the different ways possible.  Walking with my eyes, is my favorite.
*****
Mi verdadero nombre es VerÃ³nica pero gusta que me digan Veritl segÃºn yo es mi nombre  en Nahuatl.
Veritl= Mujer inquieta siempre con aventuras  en la cabeza.
Tengo 46 aÃ±os pero creo que tengo 47, me encanta decir los aÃ±os que tengo ya que creo que la edad siempre aumenta mis ganas de vivir.
Amo mi hermosa  Ciudad de MÃ©xico y me encanta que todo aquel que la visite ya sea de placer o de negocios se lleve la mejor de las experiencia. Por eso decidÃ­ compartir mi experiencia de vida  y mi  casa mexicana: un lugar para volver a ser quien eres, ese que pocas veces sale a luz, pero que cuando sale te sorprende, porque aunque lo llevas dentro muy pocas veces sales de viaje con Ã©l.

I love to travel with my camera and with my pet (if it is possible) I have good memory though a good picture is always welcome. To be in contact with the nature and let it flow through me is basic for me and a MUST.

I left my hometown like 10 years looking for traveling here and there and experience different cultures, food and places. My career landed me in Mexico City, where I have settled during the last years. I love the city because of its energy, cultural scene and excellent food at the best prices IÂ´ve seen! 

The city is huge and you donât really have to have a car to move around, there are a number of mobility options (Uber, metro, etc). In terms of safety, everything worth visiting is on pretty safe areas. My foreign friends, who have to travel by themselves during the day when Iâm at work, have moved around freely with no inconveniences - yet, if you want to save your energy, use Uber and the tour buses so you get a glimpse of the main areas, if you are here for more than one day you can try mastering the art of ridding public transport at non-peak hours. Remember, the metro is crowded but it goes everywhere and is super cheap!

As in any big city in the world, common sense comes a long way. Stay in well populated areas, and stay closer to the places you want to visit. That would make it easier to navigate the city.

Definitively leave driving to the locals, since traffic is crazy here, and drivers are not always friendly. However, if you really want to drive by yourself I recommend Waze as the app to guide you around, and leave your car only at self-service parking spots. Beware of parking restrictions if you park on the street.

This city has absolutely everything you can ask for. Sports, concerts, art, great food, archeology, shopping for any budget, history, and more. Try going during the breaks, when the locals go out on vacation and the place is not insanely crowded. The weather is also great in the spring, autumn and winter.

For him the creativity comes from his homeland. âEverything in Mexico is overwhelming. There are overwhelming colors and textures. You even go to downtown Mexico City and thereâs an overwhelming amount of people. I find my inspiration from those textures and raw materials, but also from light and color.â

But beyond buildings and the night scene, thereâs a sense of purpose for Juan Carlos. âIâd like people to see that I live in a modern, cosmopolitan city, full of contrasts. I like to show that due to its cultural mix, Mexico City is one of the most influential cities in the world. Here you can find everything.â",--,f,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/b7bc765d-510c-4d88-a470-bb296b23f33d.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/b7bc765d-510c-4d88-a470-bb296b23f33d.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Colonia CuauhtÃ©moc,"['email', 'phone']",t,t,"Mexico City, Ciudad de MÃ©xico, Mexico",CuauhtÃ©moc,0.0,Private room in rental unit,Private room,0.0,2 baths,1.0,"[""Elevator"", ""Smoke alarm"", ""Private entrance"", ""Wifi"", ""Iron"", ""Washer"", ""Essentials"", ""Hangers"", ""Hot water"", ""Fire extinguisher"", ""Kitchen"", ""Host greets you"", ""Lock on bedroom door"", ""Smoking allowed"", ""TV with standard cable"", ""Dryer"", ""Hair dryer"", ""Shampoo""]",0.0,t,30/03/23,03/07/18,03/07/18,--,f,"An entire borough is named after the former Aztec leader CuauhtÃ©moc, but this guide is for the colonia located off of Paseo Reforma, where upscale restaurants and third wave coffee shops are shoulder to shoulder with some of the best tacos in town.","An entire borough is named after the former Aztec leader CuauhtÃ©moc, but this guide is for the colonia located off of Paseo Reforma, where upscale restaurants and third wave coffee shops are shoulder to shoulder with some of the best tacos in town.",0.0,1.0,19.43421,-99.16937,1.0,0.0,1.0,650.0,1.0,30.0,1.0,2.0,30.0,30.0,1.3,30.0,0.0,29.0,59.0,89.0,364.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.02,"An entire borough is named after the former Aztec leader CuauhtÃ©moc, but this guide is for the colonia located off of Paseo Reforma, where upscale restaurants and third wave coffee shops are shoulder to shoulder with some of the best tacos in town."

Travelling one of many passions.
My house is a temple,  love to share it with guests and treat them as they deserve. The energy one feels stepping inside the house is one of ""nice to be home""
Guess I expect to feel the same, when I travel.  

As a guest I will respect every corner of the house I get in, as I shall expect the guests that stay at my house do the same -when staying at my place-.

Love to:
Eat, enchanting places, art, 
to read and a movie freak.

My favorite destinations are the cities that have tons to tell. Europe and Eastern Europe are my favorite destinations. Asia, blows my mind. When I travel to Asia, I would probably stay in one of the best venues. History is part of my life so as long as the destination has historical links, it will probably fit in this category.
