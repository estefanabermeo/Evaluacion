The experience was very good, so in September 2014 decided to join as a host, offering a couple of options and prices to stay in Mexico City.

I like that the guests enjoy their stay and their space, in total privacy.
My priority is to offer nice, clean, safe and well located place; at a  affordable rate.

La experiencia fue muy buena, por lo que en Septiembre 2014 decidÃ­ incorporarme como  anfitriÃ³n, ofreciendo un par de opciones y precios, para alojarse en la ciudad de MÃ©xico. 

Me agrada que el huÃ©sped disfrute su estancia y su espacio, en total privacidad.
Mi prioridad es ofrecer un lugar agradable, limpio, seguro y bien ubicado; a una tarifa accesible.

Siempre he vivido en la ciudad de MÃ©xico, la conozco muy bien. SerÃ¡ un placer orientarte, sugerirte y ayudarte en lo que necesites...  si asÃ­ lo deseas.

From my experience working in the tourism industry and as a traveler as well I know first hand how helpful a good tip can be in regards to where to go, places of interest, where to eat, how to get around and the importance of knowing where to go in case of a health emergency and how to stay safe. 

I currently live in Mexico City, work has brought me back to the city where I am from.
As a local and having been around for nearly 40 years I know the city extremely well. If you need any tips on where to eat, where to go, how to get around, and maybe more important WHERE NOT TO, WHEN NOT TO, and HOW NOT TO make sure to ask. I want my guests to have a great time in my place, my city and my country.

Traveling and meeting new people is my passion. I have been to many places (not enough yet) and met loads of amazing people along the way. Been in the tourism/service business for nearly 15 years, in direct contact with foreigners and expats for nearly 25, so I can communicate and advise about pretty much anything with particular great expertise. I will be a very helpful and safe host during your stay.
Unless Iâm out of town or in exceptional circumstances, very few times I donât meet my guests. I've hosted around a thousand guests from all over Mexico and the world, with a thousand different stories. I will always be interested to hear yours, happy and eager to meet travelers like you and will try to make your stay at my place as pleasant as possible.",within an hour,f,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/22ce6025-a858-4d51-839f-b6405a2745a3.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/22ce6025-a858-4d51-839f-b6405a2745a3.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,Roma Sur,"['email', 'phone', 'work_email']",t,t,"Mexico City, Distrito Federal, Mexico",CuauhtÃ©moc,0.0,Private room in rental unit,Private room,0.0,1 shared bath,1.0,"[""Clothing storage: closet and dresser"", ""Ethernet connection"", ""Free street parking"", ""BBQ grill"", ""Hot water kettle"", ""Luggage dropoff allowed"", ""Conditioner"", ""Shared patio or balcony"", ""Long term stays allowed"", ""Wine glasses"", ""Cleaning products"", ""Dining table"", ""Board games"", ""Toaster"", ""Coffee"", ""Wifi – 28 Mbps"", ""Laundromat nearby"", ""Essentials"", ""Dedicated workspace"", ""Extra pillows and blankets"", ""Oven"", ""Iron"", ""Microwave"", ""Hot water"", ""Game console"", ""Lock on bedroom door"", ""Cooking basics"", ""17"" TV with Chromecast, Netflix, standard cable"", ""Shower gel"", ""Barbecue utensils"", ""Paid parking garage off premises"", ""Drying rack for clothing"", ""Portable fans"", ""Refrigerator"", ""Hangers"", ""Fire extinguisher"", ""Kitchen"", ""Blender"", ""Smoking allowed"", ""Sound system with Bluetooth and aux"", ""First aid kit"", ""Freezer"", ""Self check-in"", ""Exercise equipment: yoga mat"", ""Building staff"", ""Books and reading material"", ""Bed linens"", ""Coffee maker"", ""Record player"", ""Gas stove"", ""Free washer – In unit"", ""Private entrance"", ""Dishes and silverware"", ""Bathtub"", ""Body soap"", ""Shampoo""]",0.0,t,30/03/23,05/11/15,05/03/23,--,f,"The place is located in Colonia Roma, an âoldâ, classic, historic district of the city that has been turned into one of the trendy, popular, vintage, âmustâ areas to visit in Mexico City.<br />It is surrounded by parks, markets, all sorts of local shops, restaurants, street food, night spots, particularly accessible distance to other tourist points (museums, landmarks, etc), bordering to other trendy districts like Condesa, JuÃ¡rez, Polanco plus close/away enough yet not too far from old downtown (city square).","The place is located in Colonia Roma, an âoldâ, classic, historic district of the city that has been turned into one of the trendy, popular, vintage, âmustâ areas to visit in Mexico City.<br />It is surrounded by parks, markets, all sorts of local shops, restaurants, street food, night spots, particularly accessible distance to other tourist points (museums, landmarks, etc), bordering to other trendy districts like Condesa, JuÃ¡rez, Polanco plus close/away enough yet not too far from old downtown (city square).",0.98,3.0,19.41066,-99.16193,2.0,0.0,1.0,358.0,1.0,1125.0,1.0,1.0,1125.0,1125.0,1.0,1125.0,0.0,0.0,19.0,49.0,49.0,346.0,38.0,2.0,4.62,4.74,4.55,4.94,4.91,4.91,4.71,2.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,3.84,"The place is located in Colonia Roma, an âoldâ, classic, historic district of the city that has been turned into one of the trendy, popular, vintage, âmustâ areas to visit in Mexico City.<br />It is surrounded by parks, markets, all sorts of local shops, restaurants, street food, night spots, particularly accessible distance to other tourist points (museums, landmarks, etc), bordering to other trendy districts like Condesa, JuÃ¡rez, Polanco plus close/away enough yet not too far from old downtown (city square)."

My first experience with Airbnb was in August 2014, as a guest, traveling to Chicago USA.
The experience was very good, so in September 2014 decided to join as a host, offering a couple of options and prices to stay in Mexico City.

I like that the guests enjoy their stay and their space, in total privacy.
My priority is to offer nice, clean, safe and well located place; at a  affordable rate.

I have always lived in Mexico City, I know it very well. It will be a pleasure to guide you and help you with any questions, suggestions that you require, or need that you have.

Love to:
Eat, enchanting places, art, 
to read and a movie freak.

My favorite destinations are the cities that have tons to tell. Europe and Eastern Europe are my favorite destinations. Asia, blows my mind.

I lived working in the service/tourism business for 5 years in Playa del Carmen Mexico, a tourism industry focused city in the Mexican Caribbean, where I learnt the tourism business and met many travelers like myself and you.
From my experience working in the tourism industry and as a traveler as well I know first hand how helpful a good tip can be in regards to where to go, places of interest, where to eat, how to get around and the importance of knowing where to go in case of a health emergency and how to stay safe. 

I currently live in Mexico City, work has brought me back to the city where I am from.
As a local and having been around for nearly 40 years I know the city extremely well. If you need any tips on where to eat, where to go, how to get around, and maybe more important WHERE NOT TO, WHEN NOT TO, and HOW NOT TO make sure to ask. I want my guests to have a great time in my place, my city and my country.

Traveling and meeting new people is my passion. I have been to many places (not enough yet) and met loads of amazing people along the way. Been in the tourism/service business for nearly 15 years, in direct contact with foreigners and expats for nearly 25, so I can communicate and advise about pretty much anything with particular great expertise. I will be a very helpful and safe host during your stay.

Soy una viajera, como tÃºâ¦ y para mi es muy importante encontrar lugares en los que me sienta bienvenida e inspirada para realizar todas esas actividades Ãºnicas que cada ciudad en el mundo tiene para ofrecer. Es por eso que decidÃ­ iniciar con la experiencia de ser hospedadora, para poder ser parte de este viaje mÃ¡gico que solo la Ciudad de MÃ©xico tiene para recibirte. 
 
Los lugares que tengo disponibles para ti, estÃ¡n ubicados en las zonas mÃ¡s bellas y seguras de esta ciudad, donde puedes encontrar desde los mejores restaurantes y antros, hasta los mÃ¡s extraÃ±os museos y galerÃ­as. Todos esperando a ser descubiertos por ti. Los departamemtos son acogedores, limpios y organizados, gracias a todo el equipo que existe junto a mi. Con quienes podrÃ¡s contar para cualquier duda que tengas durante tu estancia.
 
AdemÃ¡s de mi gusto por ser hospedadora, tambiÃ©n soy dentista en Hola Diente y en ambos casos me gusta ayudar a las personas que visitan esta ciudad. Eso me ha llevado a unir ambas vocaciones y encontrar el TURISMO DENTAL.

I am artist, dance flamenco for 23 years, though I am dedicated to the logoterapy-psicoterapy, I love swimming and I practice it regularly. I like to spend time with my family.

* Traveling: trips that I've liked most had been ""road trips"". Travel a couple of hours on the road, find the historical centres of cities or walking arround small towns, enjoy the local gastronomy, landscapes, views, and make another trip to visit or spend the night in another town. Visit national parks, beaches and countryside. Also, I like visit museums, go to the tourist attractions and have chance to go to the theatre, ballet or that goes on. I also love cruises and ski holidays.

* Countries: my favorite country is Spain, the style of life, its gastronomy, its regions and natural beauties, its contrasts and itss people 
I love Europe. I studied in England and Scotland when I was 17/18 years old, so  I'm an Anglophile's too. 
I also love Portugal, France, Italy, Switzerland, Croatia, Germany and the Scandinavian countries

For me, this journey of life is about people, places and questions. Sharing my places makes me happy as being an avid traveler for years gave me the vision of what we need when traveling. I feel honored helping you during your stay at Mexico, no matter if itâs for pleasure, work or any reason. Feel free to ask as much as you need before and during your stay. Iâve been hosting for 4 years with more than 5,000 travelers over the world. 
My life changed in 2015 when I traveled to South Asia for some months. There I discovered how big is our world and the millions of opportunities that life offers to us every time, every moment. That trip changed my perspective of what is the meaning of life. Why?  While traveling, I felt the need of sharing my stories with friends and family through social media, and thatâs why choose to continue this adventure of creating content. Then I stared writing for magazines and later a personal travel blog. 
Now life is about that: Travel, love, stories and sharing. 
Being an Airbnb host gave me the perspective of how places and experiences can connect people. 

Hoping to find new and great stories together.

For me, this journey of life is about people, places and questions. Sharing my places makes me happy as being an avid traveler for years gave me the vision of what we need when traveling. I feel honored helping you during your stay at Mexico, no matter if itâs for pleasure, work or any reason. Feel free to ask as much as you need before and during your stay. Iâve been hosting for 4 years with more than 5,000 travelers over the world. 
My life changed in 2015 when I traveled to South Asia for some months. There I discovered how big is our world and the millions of opportunities that life offers to us every time, every moment. That trip changed my perspective of what is the meaning of life. Why?  While traveling, I felt the need of sharing my stories with friends and family through social media, and thatâs why choose to continue this adventure of creating content. Then I stared writing for magazines and later a personal travel blog. 
Now life is about that: Travel, love, stories and sharing. 
Being an Airbnb host gave me the perspective of how places and experiences can connect people. 

Hoping to find new and great stories together.

ItÂ´s a name I invented in Nahuatl.
Veritl = Woman always restless with adventures in the head.
I'm 46 years old. I love to tell people how old I am because it always increases my desire to live.
I love my beautiful Mexico City and I love that anyone who visits it either for pleasure or business will have the best experience. That's why I decided to share my life experience and my Mexican house: a place to just explore who you are.
I like a lot, a lot of things: eating, laughing, exercising, reading, learning, dressing, photographing, listening, talking and shutting up, but above all, I like to walk. ItÂ´s something I enjoy excessively. I love to walk in all the different ways possible.  Walking with my eyes, is my favorite.

Amo mi hermosa  Ciudad de MÃ©xico y me encanta que todo aquel que la visite ya sea de placer o de negocios se lleve la mejor de las experiencia. Por eso decidÃ­ compartir mi experiencia de vida  y mi  casa mexicana: un lugar para volver a ser quien eres, ese que pocas veces sale a luz, pero que cuando sale te sorprende, porque aunque lo llevas dentro muy pocas veces sales de viaje con Ã©l. 
Me gustan mucho, muchas cosas:comer, reÃ­r,  hacer ejercicio, leer, aprender, vestir, fotografiar, escuchar, hablar y callar  pero  de todo lo que me gusta  para mÃ­ caminar es algo que disfruto en exceso.

For me, this journey of life is about people, places and questions. Sharing my places makes me happy as being an avid traveler for years gave me the vision of what we need when traveling. I feel honored helping you during your stay at Mexico, no matter if itâs for pleasure, work or any reason. Feel free to ask as much as you need before and during your stay. Iâve been hosting for 4 years with more than 5,000 travelers over the world. 
My life changed in 2015 when I traveled to South Asia for some months. There I discovered how big is our world and the millions of opportunities that life offers to us every time, every moment. That trip changed my perspective of what is the meaning of life. Why?  While traveling, I felt the need of sharing my stories with friends and family through social media, and thatâs why choose to continue this adventure of creating content. Then I stared writing for magazines and later a personal travel blog. 
Now life is about that: Travel, love, stories and sharing. 
Being an Airbnb host gave me the perspective of how places and experiences can connect people. 

Hoping to find new and great stories together.

I am now retired, my children are grown-ups and I own a lovely house in Colonia Condesa.

I have multiple interests and activities that fill my schedule since my retirement. I work as a therapist, I study Eastern philosophies, I love to go to the movies and to concerts, to travel and to spoil my grandson.

I am looking forward to meet all interesting people who want to enjoy the peace of this quiet place in the heart of Condesa.

Soy una viajera, como tÃºâ¦ y para mi es muy importante encontrar lugares en los que me sienta bienvenida e inspirada para realizar todas esas actividades Ãºnicas que cada ciudad en el mundo tiene para ofrecer. Es por eso que decidÃ­ iniciar con la experiencia de ser hospedadora, para poder ser parte de este viaje mÃ¡gico que solo la Ciudad de MÃ©xico tiene para recibirte. 
 
Los lugares que tengo disponibles para ti, estÃ¡n ubicados en las zonas mÃ¡s bellas y seguras de esta ciudad, donde puedes encontrar desde los mejores restaurantes y antros, hasta los mÃ¡s extraÃ±os museos y galerÃ­as. Todos esperando a ser descubiertos por ti. Los departamemtos son acogedores, limpios y organizados, gracias a todo el equipo que existe junto a mi. Con quienes podrÃ¡s contar para cualquier duda que tengas durante tu estancia.
 
AdemÃ¡s de mi gusto por ser hospedadora, tambiÃ©n soy dentista en Hola Diente y en ambos casos me gusta ayudar a las personas que visitan esta ciudad. Eso me ha llevado a unir ambas vocaciones y encontrar el TURISMO DENTAL. AsÃ­ que si tienes una emergencia dental o incluso si quieres una limpieza antes de tu prÃ³xima aventura, en Hola Diente estaremos encantados de ayudar.

Espero que puedas disfrutar de tu estancia en Ciudad de MÃ©xico, junto con los lugares de  hospedaje que tengo para ti. Bienvenidx.

For me, this journey of life is about people, places and questions. Sharing my places makes me happy as being an avid traveler for years gave me the vision of what we need when traveling. I feel honored helping you during your stay at Mexico, no matter if itâs for pleasure, work or any reason. Feel free to ask as much as you need before and during your stay. Iâve been hosting for 4 years with more than 5,000 travelers over the world. 
My life changed in 2015 when I traveled to South Asia for some months. There I discovered how big is our world and the millions of opportunities that life offers to us every time, every moment. That trip changed my perspective of what is the meaning of life. Why?  While traveling, I felt the need of sharing my stories with friends and family through social media, and thatâs why choose to continue this adventure of creating content. Then I stared writing for magazines and later a personal travel blog. 
Now life is about that: Travel, love, stories and sharing. 
Being an Airbnb host gave me the perspective of how places and experiences can connect people. 

Hoping to find new and great stories together.

Yo digo que si el destino quiere que viaje, pues yo obedezco y viajo :)

Mi pasiÃ³n es viajar y he tenido la oportunidad de explorar el mundo por diferentes medios, por aviÃ³n, por crucero, por tren, metro y casi cada medio de transporte.
Disfruto mucho conocer gente de otras nacionalidades y aprender de cada uno, por eso entre a Airbnb y cada dÃ­a estoy mÃ¡s agradecida de haberlo decidido, ya que la plataforma me ha dado muchas oportunidades y contactos, asÃ­ que ven a casa, acÃ¡ te recibimos con los brazos abiertos!
Llevo mÃ¡s de 6 aÃ±os recibiendo huÃ©spedes de todo el mundo y siendo huÃ©sped de la plataforma, incluso dentro de misma ciudad, asÃ­ que te garantizo que yo sÃ© perfectamente que es lo que mÃ¡s se necesita durante una estancia larga o corta, la calidez es clave y tener todo a la mano, le da magia al asunto, confÃ­a en mi y dÃ©jame consentirte como tu te mereces en tu estancia.

I have a degree in Tourism, my passion is to travel and life has given me the opportunity to go around the world getting to know many countries and cultures.
I have worked for the tourism industry for over ten years, even aboard Disney Cruise Line, Celebrity Cruises and Princess Cruises.
I love Mexico City because it has everything for a magnificent stay.
My favorite places are the Chapultepec Forest and Castle, the Anthropology Museum, the Centro HIstorico (central downtown and the Palace of Fine Arts.
On the outskirts is the ruins of the City of Teotihuacan and the magic town of Xochimilco.
I enjoy sharing with positive and enterprising people.
I hope to see you soonâ¦

Travelling one of many passions.
My house is a temple,  love to share it with guests and treat them as they deserve. The energy one feels stepping inside the house is one of ""nice to be home""
Guess I expect to feel the same, when I travel.  

As a guest I will respect every corner of the house I get in, as I shall expect the guests that stay at my house do the same -when staying at my place-.

Love to:
Eat, enchanting places, art, 
to read and a movie freak.

My favorite destinations are the cities that have tons to tell. Europe and Eastern Europe are my favorite destinations. Asia, blows my mind. When I travel to Asia, I would probably stay in one of the best venues. History is part of my life so as long as the destination has historical links, it will probably fit in this category.

For me, this journey of life is about people, places and questions. Sharing my places makes me happy as being an avid traveler for years gave me the vision of what we need when traveling. I feel honored helping you during your stay at Mexico, no matter if itâs for pleasure, work or any reason. Feel free to ask as much as you need before and during your stay. Iâve been hosting for 4 years with more than 5,000 travelers over the world. 
My life changed in 2015 when I traveled to South Asia for some months. There I discovered how big is our world and the millions of opportunities that life offers to us every time, every moment. That trip changed my perspective of what is the meaning of life. Why?  While traveling, I felt the need of sharing my stories with friends and family through social media, and thatâs why choose to continue this adventure of creating content. Then I stared writing for magazines and later a personal travel blog. 
Now life is about that: Travel, love, stories and sharing. 
Being an Airbnb host gave me the perspective of how places and experiences can connect people. 

Hoping to find new and great stories together.
